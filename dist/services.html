                    <h3>Color Services</h3>
                    <p>We color your hair according to your wishes and our color services bring life and naturalness to
                        your hair. The latest color technologies we use enable your hair to have a shiny and natural end
                        result. If you wish, you can give your hair a personal and trendy coloring with bold color
                        choices or a refreshing style change to match the color of your skin and eyes. However, we
                        always pay attention to the condition of the hair before color treatment, and color treatment is
                        not always possible. Color work can also be done with, for example, different stripes, sliding
                        and gloss dyeing.</p>

                    <p>Please note that we follow the cosmetics industry's recommendation not to dye the hair of
                        children under 16 years of age, and we also dye responsibly, taking into account the health and
                        safety of the customer.</p>
